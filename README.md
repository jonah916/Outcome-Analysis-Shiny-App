# Outcome-Analysis-Shiny-App

An app I made in R Shiny for an internship.
Checkboxes on the left side of the screen allows users to build custom reports and bar plots evaluating participant outcomes.
Users can choose which subsets of participants to look at; i.e., the app can filter for participants' age, primary language, and city of residence, among other fields.
