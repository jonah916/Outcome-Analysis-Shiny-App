# Outcome-Analysis-Shiny-App

An app I made in R Shiny for an internship.
App is available to the public at jonah916.shinyapps.io/ToolForDemographicAnalysis/
Checkboxes on the left side of the screen allows users to build custom reports and bar plots evaluating participant outcomes.
Users can choose which subsets of participants to look at; i.e., the app can filter for participants' age, primary language, and city of residence, among other fields. "Download" button allows users to download bar plots for future reference.
